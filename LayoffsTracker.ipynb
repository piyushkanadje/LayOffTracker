Zuckerberg expressed his hope to make these organizational changes as soon as possible in the year so that the company can move past the period of uncertainty and focus on critical work ahead.During an earnings call in February, Zuckerberg said he wants to make this the “year of efficiency.” He plans on “flattening” the company’s “structure and removing some layers of middle management to make decisions faster,” even as the company continues to spend billions to build out its vision of the metaverse.Despite sinking revenue and massive job cuts, Meta is still betting big on the future.

We are looking ahead and we are experiencing a nice quarter with new clients joining, but the growth is still not as we predicted and will be slower than expected.”'}\n",

This year’s review has been more difficult given the uncertain economy and that we’ve hired rapidly over the last several years. In November, we communicated the hard decision to eliminate a number of positions across our Devices and Books businesses, and also announced a voluntary reduction offer for some employees in our People, Experience, and Technology (PXT) organization. I also shared that we weren’t done with our annual planning process and that I expected there would be more role reductions in early 2023.Today, I wanted to share the outcome of these further reviews, which is the difficult decision to eliminate additional roles. Between the reductions we made in November and the ones we’re sharing today, we plan to eliminate just over 18,000 roles. Several teams are impacted; however, the majority of role eliminations are in our Amazon Stores and PXT organizations.\\xa0S-team and I are deeply aware that these role eliminations are difficult for people, and we don’t take these decisions lightly or underestimate how much they might affect the lives of those who are impacted. We are working to support those who are affected and are providing packages that include a separation payment, transitional health insurance benefits, and external job placement support.We typically wait to communicate about these outcomes until we can speak with the people who are directly impacted. However, because one of our teammates leaked this information externally, we decided it was better to share this news earlier so you can hear the details directly from me. We intend on communicating with impacted employees (or where applicable in Europe, with employee representative bodies) starting on January 18.Amazon has weathered uncertain and difficult economies in the past, and we will continue to do so. These changes will help us pursue our long-term opportunities with a stronger cost structure; however, I’m also optimistic that we’ll be inventive, resourceful, and scrappy in this time when we’re not hiring expansively and eliminating some roles. Companies that last a long time go through different phases. They’re not in heavy people expansion mode every year. We often talk about our leadership principle Invent and Simplify in the context of creating new products and features. There will continue to be plenty of this across all of the businesses we’re pursuing. But, we sometimes overlook the importance of the critical invention, problem-solving, and simplification that go into figuring out what matters most to customers (and the business), adjusting where we spend our resources and time, and finding a way to do more for customers at a lower cost (passing on savings to customers in the process). Both of these types of Invent and Simplify really matter.To those impacted by these reductions, I want you to know how grateful I am for your contributions to Amazon, and the work you have done on behalf of customers. You have made a meaningful difference in a lot of customers’ lives. To those who will continue on the journey with us, I look forward to partnering with you to keep making life better and easier for customers every day and relentlessly inventing to do so.Andy'}\n",

Based on the headcount mentioned on the company’s official LinkedIn page as of this article.CEO Robert Vis’ announced this move as “the hardest shift we have had to make in the history of MessageBird.” In the statement, he mentions that the company is well-positioned to overcome the fast-changing macroeconomic scenario.“MessageBird is fundamentally well-positioned to overcome economic headwinds and our products and tools are purposefully designed to help customers build economies of scale, especially during these tough economic times. High quality at a lower cost for our customers has made us win in the past and will enable us to win in the future.”Here is a full statement from the  – Source blog.messagebird.comToday we’re announcing the hardest shift we have had to make in the history of MessageBird. We’re reducing the size of our team overall by around 31% (including the announcement on Oct 31), saying goodbye to many talented Birds. If you are part of the Birds being impacted you will receive a notification within 15 minutes to your MessageBird and private email.\\xa0For those of you leaving: I’m very sorry to be taking this step and I take full responsibility for the decisions leading up to it. I hope that the clarity in this note will show you my full ownership for this decision and the path forward.There are more details later in this note on how we are approaching departures, but first, I want to share some broader context.We have seen a significant shift over the past months in the global economy resulting in rising inflation, rising interest rates and a change in the way businesses are valued. We live in unprecedented times and I am convinced that 2023 will see most of the global economy falling into recession. We bootstrapped MessageBird profitably for the first 6 years, spent the next 5 years investing and made the company profitable again late 2021. While we continue to operate profitably in 2022 and sustain our growth rates ahead of our peers, unfortunately we still need to take more drastic measures for the health of our business and to continue to support and prepare our customers and our stakeholders from what is about to come.\\xa0To be clear, as much as I believe this to be necessary it is not a reflection of me not caring for those we are asking to leave – this day leaves a scar on my soul. MessageBird is my legacy, the company I give my everything for every single day and would sacrifice almost anything for. The decision today is more painful for the Birds leaving than it will be for me and I won’t pretend I understand what they will go through. I alone made the mistakes leading up to this and I should have seen it coming earlier. We grew our headcount too fast and did not integrate our acquisitions at the speed needed so that we would not find ourselves having to make today’s announcement. I’m sorry for what this decision might mean for our Birds that are leaving and will give my best for our Birds remaining so that this will not happen again.\\xa0In business speed matters, MessageBird has always been a fast paced company and some thrive in such an environment while others find it unreasonable. Building a business requires hard work and tenacity. Our employee experience should be strongly centred around the impact we all have on our customers’ experience. A business is built through continuous rigour, hard work and having the flexibility to adapt to changes as new data presents itself. This is how we bootstrapped MessageBird and built it up in the first few years, and also how we will continue to scale our business going forward.MessageBird is fundamentally well-positioned to overcome economic headwinds and our products and tools are purposefully designed to help customers build economies of scale, especially during these tough economic times. High quality at a lower cost for our customers has made us win in the past and will enable us to win in the future.We are making this decision as a way to go back to our roots, a time where we bootstrapped and operated at the highest financial and operational rigour. Our customers and shareholders (including you) deserve products and services at the best price point that provide a best-in-class return on investment. We have always been proud of being an efficient business and we are convinced that this is the only way to grow long term and ultimately win in a healthy, sustainable manner.Around 31% of people at MessageBird will have left the company by the end of this year, compared to our headcount numbers in October of this year. As I said before, I take full responsibility for this decision. It is incredibly painful to realise that we could not live up to our expectations of providing a successful long-term career in the nest to those now impacted.It will never feel good to part ways but we will do our best to treat everyone leaving with respect and seek ways to support them in such a difficult situation. A few core elements include:\\xa0Birds that are leaving will receive a notification email to both their MessageBird as well as their personal email address within the next 15 minutes. A manager will reach out to every departing Bird over the course of the next day for a 1:1 conversation. Look out for an invite coming to your personal email address.Please know that this is definitely not a decision I imagined we would make when we hired you. We know that you would have continued to contribute in an amazing way under different circumstances. We care about you as former colleagues and birds in our extended nest, appreciating everything you’ve done for the company.\\xa0 We would like to encourage you to stay connected with us so we can share updates and also contact you in the future should an opportunity to return to MessageBird arise and encourage you to join our alumni community. We also encourage companies who are looking for amazing talent to consider our departing Birds; they will thrive in any fast-paced, high growth environment.I wish you all the very best for a healthy and successful future; we will always be grateful for what you have done for the company!I know that this is also a difficult situation for you as you see members of the team leaving. Your manager and all s-team members will be available to you in case you need individual support. I know there will be questions over the next week as we go through a lot of change in different parts of the organisation. We ask for your patience and support in helping us navigate through the next few days as we continue to run the business as well as say good-bye to fellow Birds. On Thursday, let’s talk about how we will reset, reorganise and move forward during our All-Hands.We will use the next couple of days to meet with you all to answer additional questions but also give more tangible insights into our path forward, the way we will organise ourselves and how we envision everyone collaborating in the future. Please also huddle as teams and find the strength to get through this difficult time together. We obviously count on you to drive the business forward with us, help us stay laser focused on our priorities and build efficiencies to further increase the value of the company and thus all of your equity value.\\xa0Today is the beginning of a journey that unfortunately started with a very painful decision and message to you all. I recognize it will take some time to regain your trust in me as the CEO, in my leadership team, and the company altogether. I fully take ownership and will do my best to win back your trust and confidence in me and us as MessageBird. I am more convinced than ever that going back to our roots is the key to our success and symbolises the beginning of a successful journey that goes beyond everything we expected to achieve when I founded the company in 2011.\\xa0The data we see is consistent with this encouraging outlook as we surpassed $600m run rate revenue with organic growth well above our peers and during Black Friday processed a whopping 254 million emails every hour and 3.3 billion during the day. Our company is vertically integrated to address every touch point of the customer journey and be in full control of our customers’ experience with us.\\xa0You joined MessageBird because you are excited about the opportunities we have to help our customers make communicating with a business as easy as talking to a friend. In times of uncertainty around us, our customers are looking for even more scalable and flexible ways of communicating, hence our unique opportunity to support them through new products and innovations.Today is a sad day for all of us as we say goodbye to a number of talented Birds. In the next couple of days, we’ll do our best to support those who are leaving the company. Next week we will reset and move forward. While the changes today are painful, I know it is the right thing to do to keep MessageBird’s position strong and use the global headwinds for those around us to our advantage and to master the future.Best from Amsterdam,\\xa0– Robert'}\n",

The news was first reported by Geekwire. The layoffs will be impacting around 90 employees based on the company’s LinkedIn profile page. The company was the only local marketplace second to facebook’s after it acquired Letgo in March 2020 and joined to become Unicorn.OfferUp Team: Today is a difficult day for OfferUp and its employees, as I just met with some of our friends and colleagues to let them know that they are leaving OfferUp.\\xa0 This was a tough decision and it will have significant impacts on the people who are leaving, those who are staying, and the Company, so I wanted to take a few minutes to share with you the reasons for the decision and why I think it is necessary for OfferUp’s long-term success.Before I talk about the future, I want to acknowledge our colleagues who are leaving.\\xa0 They are valued contributors to OfferUp who had the misfortune to be in roles that are not required for our 2023 plans.\\xa0 We will miss them and I encourage you to reach out to them.\\xa0 I want you to know that we are doing everything we can to ease this transition.\\xa0 For those who are leaving today, we are offering:We wish our colleagues well and we hope to cross paths with them again in the future. Please join me in thanking them for their contributions to OfferUp.Now I’d like to talk about how we came to this decision.\\xa0\\xa0Many other companies at our stage are currently laying off employees and cutting costs because they face the possibility of going out of business if they don’t.\\xa0 Fortunately, we are not in that position and had multiple years of runway before the changes today.\\xa0 Having a stronger financial position is a benefit, but it can also allow leadership to avoid hard choices that are necessary.\\xa0\\xa0We grew headcount rapidly over the past few years – at a rate that outpaced revenue growth.\\xa0 I had hoped that our 2022 operating plan would generate enough revenue growth to allow us to grow into our current cost structure.\\xa0 However, by mid-year, it became clear that we would miss our revenue growth projections. The management team and the Board had a number of strategic discussions, both internally and with advisors, about how to proceed. These conversations always ended with the same conclusion – our current cost structure is preventing us from achieving our goals.\\xa0\\xa0We have built a large and active marketplace that serves tens of millions of users every month, but we’re not yet at a revenue scale that allows us to thrive without continued growth.\\xa0 At our stage, we need to demonstrate at least 2 or 3 of the following factors:\\xa0Our cost structure has not allowed us to make as much progress on these factors as we should have.\\xa0 As one example, to save expenses, we’ve mostly relied on organic growth in recent years.\\xa0 We spent a fraction of what other marketplaces spend on marketing, missing the opportunity to further raise awareness of OfferUp.\\xa0 Successful marketing tests earlier this year and increasing revenue per user give us some signal that we can spend more to bring users onto our platform in a manner that will be sustainable and profitable.\\xa0 However, that investment was not possible with our cost structure.\\xa0 There are other ways that we hope to do more by shifting our spending that I will share as we discuss more over the coming weeks.I am enthusiastic about the 2023 plan we just previewed with the Board, and I look forward to sharing details with all of you in the coming weeks.\\xa0 This is a plan that is both attainable and exciting, and it is only possible because of the additional capital available as a result of today’s decision.\\xa0 With a leaner, nimbler Company in 2023, we intend to:Our 2023 plan is very focused on our best opportunities.\\xa0 If we achieve these plans, we will have many more options than we have today.\\xa0 It’s important that everyone who continues with OfferUp has the opportunity to benefit from those increased options, so I’ll be sharing some plans we have to share Company success with each of you.\\xa0\\xa0The leadership team will host a town hall discussion and listening session this Friday.\\xa0 More details on where to submit your questions for the town hall will come later today.\\xa0I want to close by thanking you for your continued support of OfferUp and assuring you that I will do all I can to make sure that support is appropriately rewarded.\\xa0 For those of you who don’t have any urgent tasks today, please feel free to take the rest of the day to process today’s news.Todd'}\n",

We’ll still need home-services employees for our concierge service to fix up brokerage customers’ listings, but since that group spent most of its time renovating RedfinNow homes, it will get much smaller.We’re meeting with the RedfinNow and home-services teams at 6:15 a.m. and 8:15 a.m. Pacific time. We’ll start calling the folks being asked to leave other departments at 8:00 a.m. local time, and then send an email out to everyone else when we’re done.With this layoff, the number of employees at Redfin, including those at Rent and Bay Equity, will decline by 13%. Since April 30, the number of people working here has fallen 27%. We’ve also eliminated the roles of 218 employees who can choose over the next few days to stay at Redfin in another role; if all of those employees were to leave, the reduction would be 16% in November and 29% since April.A layoff is awful but we can’t avoid it. We plan to keep increasing our share of the market, but that market in 2023 is likely to be 30% smaller than it was in 2021. The June layoff was a response to our expectation that we’d sell fewer houses in 2022; this layoff assumes the downturn will last at least through 2023.To every departing employee who put your faith in Redfin, thank you. I’m sorry that we don’t have enough sales to keep paying you. The severance pay is the same as before: ten to fifteen weeks of pay depending on Redfin tenure, and healthcare coverage for three months. More information is on\\xa0Fin.\\xa0There’ll be another time to discuss our plans to grow, starting with this afternoon’s earnings call. But we need a moment now to say why we’re closing our iBuying business, when we’ve said for years that it drives listing share. One problem is that the share gains we could attribute to iBuying have become less certain as we rolled it out more broadly, especially now that our offers are so low.\\xa0And the second problem is that iBuying is a staggering amount of money and risk for a now-uncertain benefit. We’ve tied up hundreds of millions of dollars in houses that you yourself wouldn’t want to own right now. Even before its overhead expenses, the RedfinNow properties segment will likely lose $22 – $26 million dollars in 2022. However small our iBuying loss may be compared to others, that loss is still larger than we could afford to bear again.All of us, myself included, have to grieve for RedfinNow and other projects now ending. We’ll be ridiculed for thinking they could’ve succeeded. But having strained ourselves to the limit for a long time, we have to acknowledge that, even if we had the money to do more, we’ll be happier and more successful doing less, and doing it well. It will be good to focus on our original calling: getting people a higher, not a lower, price for their homes, at a 1% fee, and supporting people through their entire move, from the mobile application to the agent to the lender to the title specialist.We’ll show our true colors over the coming year by putting customers first and taking market share, as we have every year through good and bad markets. We’ll show our true colors today by caring for those who are leaving. I won’t pretend it isn’t heartbreaking.\\xa0A cyclical industry makes it hard to build a caring culture. We could be cynical and stop trying to care, or even more cynical and say we only pretended to try. But those of us still here tomorrow will have remained for a reason, united by a now-ancient belief that what’s smaller can become bigger, that the only thing more inevitable than love’s failures are its triumphs. Whether you’re staying or going, you can, as always, call my cell, to vent, to plan your next career move, to ask questions, to say goodbye.Sincerely, Glenn'}\n",

While we are positioned well for the future in the long term given our market opportunity and financial position, we are in the unfortunate situation where we have to make corrections to our scale and structure to build a more efficient, stronger organization for the future. We announced a reorg that impacted roughly 10% of the company. This decision was very difficult, and we want to first thank everyone – especially outgoing employees – for all their hard work. These are some very talented people, let us do our best to open our networks to help them. We wish those impacted continued success in their careers and remain committed to our customers and partners around the world. This decision may shock many of you and may take some time to process. In the spirit of transparency, I’d like to share more about what happened and where we’ll go from here. What happened? At the start of Q2, macroeconomic factors began impacting public companies and the financing environment. As you know, we changed our hiring plan to align with priorities and started implementing stricter fiscal discipline to reorient the company towards long-term sustainability. Since then, the global economic environment has continued to be uncertain – but it is clear that this new reality will require companies to move toward profitability at an accelerated pace. Our years in high-growth mode have created operational needs across the company, which is impacting our ability to execute. Facing a growing gap between our revenue and spend, we have been reducing our expenses across various areas including tools, consulting, and contractors, etc. While the scaling decisions were under our control and responsibility, the economic situation and lack of visibility into the future has made it harder for everyone. This decision was not made lightly and we will do our best to support our team members who were impacted today. What are we doing to support our colleagues leaving Chargebee?What are we doing to support our colleagues leaving Chargebee?In March 2020, when we were a 200+ member team facing uncertain market conditions, we considered a similar approach. At that time, the team rallied behind us and we will always be grateful for their support. Today, the scale at which we are operating makes it very difficult to control expenses with costs that increase with each individual, including programs they need to be successful in their jobs.We have a responsibility to build a financially sound business for the greater interest of everyone involved. While historically I have been philosophically opposed to layoffs, after careful consideration, it is best to act now to offer separation packages to affected colleagues with the following principal components:• 3 months of pay while they look for new opportunities; • 3 months of extended medical benefits; • Outplacement career services that include networking assistance, resume writing, and interview preparation to help them find new opportunities sooner; and • An extension of time to exercise stock options granted under our stock incentive plan so that more people can benefit from their contributions to the company.I request that we all support our teammates through this difficult time – treat others how you would want to be treated.How will we move forward?It is sad to say goodbye to our friends and it’s important to acknowledge the talented individuals who helped get us where we are today. Although we still face uncertain headwinds, I want to reinforce my belief in our long-term market opportunity.The global SaaS market is still forecasted to grow significantly, and Chargebee is well capitalized to grow along with it. More importantly, every customer conversation only reinforces that the problems we’re solving remain acute and pervasive. The vision for our product remains strong and we will continue to rise to meet the multitude of market opportunities in the long term.While it’s human nature to rejoice in the good times, it’s adversity that not only builds character and skills, but also creates lifelong memories and friendships. I urge you all to come together as a team and leverage our professional networks to find opportunities for those impacted.I’m sure you will all have questions – and we are here to answer them transparently and to the best of our ability. Here is a Slido link to submit. I will review this regularly to answer questions as they come up.We remain grateful. Thank you for continuing on this journey with us.Regards, Krish.'}\n",

(the “Company’) is reducing its workforce to reduce costs, eliminate overlapping functions, and to meet the general operational needs of the Company. The Company considered the following factors when deciding which positions would be affected: (1) the future needs of the Company for the duties performed by the position; (2) whether the functions of the position could be assumed by an employee in a different position; (3) the education and experience of the employee currently in the position; and (4) the performance of the employee currently holding the position.All of the employees whose positions are affected will be offered a severance package in exchange for their agreement to a general release of claims.Pursuant to federal law, employees over the age of 40 will be allowed to consider their release agreements for 45 days and, after the agreement is executed, may revoke the agreement within 7 days. Employees under the age of 40 will have 5 business days to consider their release agreements but may not revoke their release agreements once they are signed.In layoff situations where an employer offers release packages to a group of employees, employment laws require the employer to disclose certain information to the affected employees over the age of 40 who are considering the release. The Agreement of which this document is a part satisfies this disclosure requirement. The table below identifies every position in the affected employee’s decisional unit within the Company, the age of the person holding the position, and whether the individual’s position is affected.'}\n",

Aims for profitability in 2023 announced on Wednesday, that the company is undergoing restructuring and letting go of 11% of its overall workforce.The company’s CEO Jeff Lawson in a letter on Wednesday to its employees announced the reduction in workforce. As of this article, the company has around 8900 employees as per their LinkedIn page ~ which makes it around 1000 employees being impacted by the layoffs.The company is looking at an expense between $70~$90 Mn directly related charges to layoffs. Company’s shares took a beating on Wednesday which dropped by more than 5% on the news.September\\xa014, 2022\\xa0Important: Focusing Twilio more and reducing our size\\xa0Twilions,\\xa0Over the years, we’ve made lots of changes to the way Twilio operates and is organized, but none harder than what I’m sharing today.\\xa0We’ve made the extremely difficult decision to restructure and reduce Twilio’s workforce by approximately 11% – teammates and friends who helped build Twilio.\\xa0I’m not going to sugarcoat things. A layoff is the last thing we want to do, but I believe it’s wise and necessary. Twilio has grown at an astonishing rate over the past couple years. It was too fast, and without enough focus on our most important company priorities. I take responsibility for those decisions, as well as the difficult decision to do this layoff.\\xa0Before I get into the details, I want to answer the obvious question which is likely on your mind:\\xa0In the US, impacted Twilions will get an email within the next 60 minutes letting them know their role has been impacted and outlining next steps. Twilions who are impacted will also be able to meet with a leader from their team or an HRBP today.\\xa0Outside the US, Twilio operates in 20 countries, so notifications and next steps will vary based on local laws and practices. Regardless, all Twilions whose roles are or may be impacted outside the US can expect an email or meeting invitation within the next two hours.\\xa0For Twilions in all regions: If you don’t receive one of these emails or meeting invitations in the next two hours, it means your role has not been impacted.\\xa0Let me start by stating the obvious: Ideally, everyone would be hearing this news directly from their manager, but that would have left many Twilions waiting anxiously for an extended period of time. The process differs by country, but we wanted to give clarity as quickly as possible.\\xa0Twilio has always been a growth company. And as you know, we’re committed to being a profitable growth company. At our scale, being profitable will make us stronger. It requires us to ask more rigorously which activities and investments are working. It forces us to ask where we have good alignment internally to amplify each of our efforts. This discipline requires us to ask if our investments are getting us where we need to go.\\xa0As we’ve discussed frequently, we have four priorities for reaching profitability and leading in customer engagement: Investing in our platform reliability and trust, increasing the profitability of messaging, accelerating Segment adoption, and scaling the Flex customer base. Today’s layoffs are about aligning our investments more squarely with our priorities, as well as running our company more efficiently overall.\\xa0Full stop, these are our priorities. As they have been for a while now. But we must sharpen our focus more than ever. I am asking Twilio’s leaders to further examine their priorities, and any Twilion has full permission to question every other activity that doesn’t help us achieve our company priorities in a measurable way. I am not asking you all to “do more with less.” I’m asking the company to actually do fewer things better. I take responsibility for choosing to grow our team faster and to pursue many priorities beyond these four priorities over the recent years. And now, I also own the decision to become more focused – resulting in this layoff.\\xa0I know that we can succeed in becoming the leading Customer Engagement Platform we envision. I just came back from APJ where I met with over two dozen customers. There’s a hunger for where we’re going – and key to that success in the coming years is accelerating Segment and Flex. That won’t happen without the concerted focus and investment I’m emphasizing today.\\xa0This was tremendously difficult. For those impacted today, we applied a rigorous selection process to examine which roles were most tightly aligned to our four priorities. Similarly, we looked at the size of the investments we’ve made and whether they are working for our company. We ultimately found that some investments no longer make sense and identified areas where we can be more efficient. By no fault of the Twilions impacted today, we’ve curtailed our investment in areas of Go To Market where customers can succeed without as much human intervention, as well as making targeted changes to be more efficient in areas of R&D and G&A.\\xa0As you all know, we are committed to becoming an Anti-Racist/Anti-Oppression company. Layoffs like this can have a more pronounced impact on marginalized communities, so we were particularly focused on ensuring our layoffs – while a business necessity today – were carried out through an Anti-Racist/Anti-Oppression lens.\\xa0I want to do our best to take care of you in this transition and set you up for success in what comes next. All impacted Twilions globally will receive at least 12 weeks of pay, plus one week for every year of service at Twilio. You’ll also receive the full value of Twilio’s next stock vest because the Twilions who are leaving us are shareholders too – which is important to us.\\xa0In the US and in most regions, you will be able to remain on company payroll while searching for your next role, whether it be inside or outside Twilio. Our Talent Acquisition team will give high-touch service to impacted Twilions if there’s an open internal role in one of our investment areas. We will create a list that impacted employees can opt into, which we’ll share with other companies who may be hiring, as well as investors who know many such companies.\\xa0I know this is especially hard news for those Twilions who depend on Twilio-sponsored visas. We’ll be giving those team members even more support to hopefully minimize the disruption to them and their families as they work through their immigration status.\\xa0I am deeply sorry to see you all leave Twilio. You have all been part of building our company. You’ve been our teammates, partners, and friends. I’m grateful for your contributions to our customers and our business. And we owe it to you to help as much as we can.\\xa0We are builders. This is all part of the complicated, difficult and at times emotional journey as builders. No doubt, it will be a hard few months as we change the shape of our company for the opportunity ahead. We’ll have an All Hands meeting tomorrow to talk more about that.\\xa0Today, it’s okay to be a bit shocked and feel sad. And to support your colleagues. I am confident that we’ll look back at this as a difficult time – but one that set up Twilio well for the future. Please see Switchboard for more details about today’s news.\\xa0–jeffiel\\xa0'}\n",

As summarized in GRO EVP Manlio Carrelli’s email below, we have decided to consolidate the GRO (Global Revenue Org) and GSO (Global Service Org) teams, returning to one Global Revenue Organization. Some changes were also made in the GPT (Global Product & Technology) and G&A (General & Administrative) teams. Approximately, 193 people out of our 1,687 were let go and I know for those people, and the 1,400 people that are here today, this has a significant and emotional impact. There were two other times over our 26 years that we had to restructure the company, once during the dotcom and then when we made a pivot from being a chat company to messaging/Al and each time we became a stronger and better company. This restructuring will mean different things for different people, but the main goal is to ensure that the “whole” of the company continues the pursuit of its long-term vision. This restructuring was critical to ensure that we are in a healthy position as we now have a clear line of sight to generating strong operating margins and cash flow. Live Person got here because for over twenty years, we generated cash flow and had a healthy business model. At the end of 2021, we heavily invested and ramped up our teams with the understanding at that time that the demand we saw during Covid would continue.

Olive AI had announced to be in a hiring freeze and assured will not be undergoing layoffs in an employees town hall in May.Olivians,I’m writing to you today to share that we are transforming our business strategy, which requires that we reduce the size of our employee base by approximately 450 people. I realize this is hard news to hear, especially for those who will be leaving our team. I hope the information provided here will illuminate why we arrived at this difficult decision, how we will support our colleagues who are leaving, and how our business will operate and thrive moving forward.Those impacted will receive an email shortly from a member of the Olive People team to the personal email addresses we have on file in Workday. This email will inform them that their official employment will end in 60 days, but their last day of work is today. It will also include information about their separation, where to find related documents, what to do with Olive-issued equipment, and how to participate in one-on-one conversations hosted by the Olive People team.We understand that communicating this via email is not ideal and, of course, would have preferred to do so individually, but given the size of this change, we wanted to provide clarity to everyone as soon as possible.We’ve grown rapidly over the last several years in service of creating a new healthcare experience for humankind. Olive’s values of “choose vision over status quo” and “act with urgency” drove us to make significant investments across the most pressing parts of healthcare, scale our teams and move quickly to bring solutions to the market.The realities of today’s economy are forcing us to rethink this approach. While we are experiencing many of the same headwinds as other organizations — including shifts in the industry landscape, evolving customer expectations, and challenging market conditions — we also must reconcile missteps we made. Our fast-paced growth and lack of focus strained our product and engineering resources and prevented us from executing quickly on key initiatives. I take responsibility for this.To become a stronger, more sustainable company, we must transform our strategy to achieve profitability sooner than we originally planned. This means we must deliver on commitments, expand our customer base, drive steady revenue growth and continue creating value for the market and our customers.To do this, we will focus on doing one thing, doing it incredibly well, and measuring what matters. Going forward, that one thing is the critical connection between providers and payers, starting with Autonomous Revenue Cycle for providers and Utilization Management Transformation for payers. Not only do these solution journeys comprise the vast majority of our current business footprint — more than 80% of our existing revenue and pipeline — but they are the foundation upon which Olive can continue to drive transformational value for the entire healthcare ecosystem.Prioritizing end-to-end processes that enable payer-provider connectivity as our go-forward strategy provides us a unique advantage in the market, and gives us confidence as we look ahead. And our expectations are still high for what we can achieve — we remain deeply passionate about solving healthcare’s biggest problems. Today’s announcement means we will get more precise with how we do that.A more focused strategy requires a more focused organizational structure. With our new strategy in hand, we set out to build an organization that has the right roles in the right places to allow us to deliver on our goals and ensure we remain on the pathway to profitability. We started by identifying the critical positions needed to support our new strategy, and optimizing reporting lines to drive clear ownership and efficiency across the company. This exercise led to the consolidation of some teams across our sales, customer, product, and engineering divisions, and the elimination of teams and roles at all levels that weren’t directly tied to our go-forward plans.We move into this new organizational structure today, which means we will say goodbye to friends and teammates we care about and who have made meaningful contributions to Olive. This was an incredibly difficult decision but one necessary for Olive moving forward.It is important to me that those impacted feel supported through this transition. With this in mind, departing employees will receive:Those not departing today will receive an email from the Olive People team to their Olive email address shortly with additional details about what’s next. In the coming hours, we will send a calendar invite for an upcoming all-company meeting where we will discuss our new strategy in greater detail — our focus areas, structure, changes in leadership and more. I am personally committed to regular communication as we move forward because I know our strategy requires that we stay closely aligned.\\xa0Because it is part of our DNA at Olive to care deeply about our customer and partner relationships, I want you to know that we will be communicating directly with each of our customers and partners shortly.For those departing, I’d like to express my sincere gratitude for everything you’ve done for Olive. We wish you the best and are committed to providing you with resources to help you move forward. For those Olivians who remain, we understand you’ll need time to process this news. Please reach out to your leader with questions.\\xa0This is going to be an incredibly difficult day. But Olive’s mission is critical, and we are confident this strategy is the right one. I’m inspired by what we’ve achieved together thus far and know that with this transformation, we will ensure Olive’s impact for many years to come.Sean Lane, CEO'}\n",

We’ll also be helping with job placement and opening our personal networks to support them however we can. Finally, thanks to your compassion and support, we were able to notify each person one on one, in person. We’ve been through winter before, and we built this company with the cyclicality of crypto in mind. We’ve also built a very strong balance sheet through the money we’ve raised and the product-market fit we’ve proven.Nevertheless, the reality is that we have entered an unprecedented combination of crypto winter and broad macroeconomic instability, and we need to prepare the company for the possibility of a prolonged downturn. The changes we’re making today put us in a position to maintain multiple years of runway under various crypto winter scenarios (5 years at the current volume), and give us high confidence that we will only have to go through this process once.We have a huge opportunity in front of us. During this winter, I expect that we’ll see an explosion in innovation and utility across NFTs. With the hard (but important) changes we made today, we’re in an even better position to capture what will soon become the largest market on the planet. When the global economy is uncertain, our mission to build the foundation for new, peer-to-peer economies feels more urgent and important than ever.

This is their 2nd round of layoffs since the pandemic.Important company changesDear team,Over the past few months, | have had the privilege to share with you some of my mostmeaningful business reflections as we look back and collectively build forward. Today, at our all-hands meeting, | shared with you some difficult news. For those who were unable to attend our all-hands meeting, | announced that we’ve made the difficult decision to restructure the company requiring a reduction in the size of Ritual’s workforce. Of the 148 people who work for Ritual, 23 will be leaving the company today representing 15.5% of our workforce.During our call today, | shared details about how we came to this decision, who is affected and our plan to take care of those who are departing. Our focus today is on taking care of each other so | wanted to share with you as much as possible about our decision and where we go next.Why are these changes happening?The word ‘unpredictable’ summarizes the challenges our business has faced over the last two years. With no playbooks on how to navigate a global pandemic, we saw major shifts in our business, first losing a significant portion of revenue from office closures, then seeing our residential business grow as we went in and out of lockdowns. Over the last few months, we’ve seen downtown cores rebound but a new challenge is emergingas we prepare for a recession.While the weight of recession can be heavy, we are now entering a more predictable time. We have been through many recessions and because of that, we understand that consumer discretionary spending will go down and restaurants will be looking to cut costs to keep prices competitive. To succeed in this environment, we need to continue to offer value to our customers by focusing on the fewer, more impactful products andkeeping our prices low and we can only do that by keeping our operating costs low too.Accordingly, we made the decision to concentrate our resources on fewer products and services we believe will really matter to our users, restaurant partners and workplaces. Our mission to help restaurants thrive by delivering great digital experiences, cost-effectively, to customers is as important as ever.What does it mean for those whose roles are affected?For those whose roles are affected, we know that the news from today is challenging and brings with it so much uncertainty. While there is little we can do to change that, our focus has been on providing a transition plan that puts them in the best position for their tomorrow. We will be connecting with everyone individually in more detail but our plan includes:Severance 3month extension of full health and dental benefits for all departing employees and their dependents until September.Severance packages based on employee tenure.Hardware assistance programs to allow employees to keep company equipment that they may need. Reference letters, 1:1 interview coaching and resume reviews.| want to stress that the roles that were eliminated were a function of us focusing our investments and not a reflection of the performance of those individuals or teams. Ritual employees are some of the most sought-after tech talent in Toronto and we plan on using our talent team, company resources and our investor networks to support each of the 23 people to find their next opportunity.What happens now?By now, it has been communicated to affected employees that their role was impacted by this decision. For those departing, we will be connecting privately to discuss the details of their package and the support they will receive. Although departing employees will no longer have access to sensitive corporate information, we have left Slack & Zoom access open until 3 pm today. | encourage all of you to take time to celebrate and personally support this group that has contributed so much to Ritual.Today is a tough day for all of us with a lot to process so let’s focus on supporting those who are departing. Tomorrow during our company AMA, we will walk through more details on our re-org and go-forward plan where we can answer any and all questions you may have.Sincerely,Ray'}\n",

This meant we had to part ways with some of the new team members, despite them being above our standard quality threshold – and you know that is high. We had a target cost and we did this exercise across functions with duration as the main variable and only the absolute stars made it through this unreasonably tough standard.”It is also to note that the data-driven company was valued at $842 million just last month after its series D funding round of $109mn backed by Motive partners and Franklin Templeton.Vinay credits the decision to the coming economic conditions – “In the last Townhall, I had shared how we are preparing for the coming economic conditions, and how we could turn what is distressing for most, into an opportunity for us.”More of the email from Vinay Nair-”\\xa0I wanted to share an update. After capitalizing the business with our series D, we have now completed the process to rightsize our cost structure for the current environment. We started with an annualized cost structure of ~74mm and have made adjustments to now decrease this to ~64mm. . On the revenue front, today, we have over 30mm in annualized revenues. Making our burn around 34mm. We also have over 50mm in cash. This ensures that with moderate revenue growth (which, to be clear, is not our goal) we should have the capital we need, well into 2024 and beyond; or to make opportunistic investments as opportunities arrive in short order (Q4 onwards).

The gathering saw Ravid tell staff that the ongoing economic downturn—which has hit the tech sector hard and led to a slowdown in venture capital funding—has forced the company to cut back on expenses. “The market environment that we operate in has changed dramatically,” Ravid told staff on the video call. “For the past three years since late 2019, venture capital has flowed quite freely into fintech and financial services, and we’ve benefited from this trend. That trend has changed dramatically this year.”'}\n",
